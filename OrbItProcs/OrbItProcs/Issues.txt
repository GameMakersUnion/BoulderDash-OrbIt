ISSUES LIST.

- need to make priority listings for draw, affect loops
- add 'reset to default' button when right clicking component (or fields: get the default value in the class)
- make sure that components that have costly 'affectself' methods (that only produce graphical effects) are not
	called. (only the most significant graphical logic code should be executed) (example: laser/wideray)

- the serialization does not work for the Modifier component (this could be because the Tuple<> AND the delegate)
- make it so that the modifier component doesn't set all node references to it's parent when updatingreferences (probably for processes)






============================== Fixed =================================
- the defaultNode and NodePreset nodes don't fully remove their components from comps when using the RemoveComponent function
